# Contributing to macOS M4 Development Setup

We welcome contributions to improve the macOS M4 Development Setup scripts! This document outlines the process for contributing to this project.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/m4.git`
3. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. Make your changes
5. Test your changes thoroughly
6. Submit a pull request

## Code Style Guidelines

### Shell Scripts
- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Use `set -euo pipefail` for error handling
- Use double quotes for variable expansion
- Use meaningful variable names
- Include comments for complex logic
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)

### Function Naming
- Use descriptive function names with underscores
- Prefix functions with their module name where appropriate
- Example: `setup_git()`, `install_homebrew()`

### Error Handling
- Always check command exit codes
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Use the `confirm()` function for user interactions
- Handle edge cases gracefully

## Script Structure

Each script should follow this structure:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script Description
# Part of macOS M4 Development Setup Suite

confirm() {
  read -p "$1 [y/N]: " -n 1 -r
  echo
  [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]
}

function_name() {
  echo "Doing something..."
  # Implementation
  echo "Done."
}

# Main execution
if [[ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" == "${0}" ]]; then
  echo "ðŸ”§ Script Name"
  confirm "Do something?" && function_name
  echo "âœ… Script complete!"
fi
```

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. Test your script on a clean macOS M4 system
2. Test both interactive and non-interactive modes
3. Verify that the script can be run multiple times safely
4. Check that all dependencies are properly handled
5. Test the master script integration
